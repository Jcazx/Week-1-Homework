The aim of this project was to work to refactor an existing site (HTML + CSS) to make it more accessible, to amend errors within the CSS + HTML, and to generally tidy up the code.

This included:

- amending HTML to include semantic elements
- fixing broken links
- adding alt elements to images to improve accessibility
- improving quality of the title element
- consolidating the selectors and properties in the CSS and organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
- including comments before each element or section of the page to make the code more easily readable.
- As a final result all links now function as intended, the HTML and CSS sheets are clear and easy to follow and the added alt attributes for the image will make the site more accessible.
